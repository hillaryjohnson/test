Be careful around this one!"}, "3"=>{"points"=>"0", "truthiness"=>"0", "id"=>"4", "abody"=>"Velocity is the average productivity per team member per hour.", "feedback"=>"You just revealed yourself to be a die-hard bean-counter, didn't you?

4:   <p>Here are a few questions about the art of agile estimation, which we like to refer to as "story sizing." As in life, some answers are more right than others. Your task isn't to pick the "right" answer, but the best answer. Seems more realistic, doesn't it?. You'll get some points for good answers, and more points for great answers. You'll also get feedback based on your answers. We hope you learn something, whatever your level of expertise.</p>

5:   <p>Here are a few questions about the art of agile estimation, which we like to refer to as "story sizing." As in life, some answers are more right than others. Your task isn't to pick the "right" answer, but the best answer. Seems more realistic, doesn't it?. You'll get some points for good answers, and more points for great answers. You'll also get feedback based on your answers. We hope you learn something, whatever your level of expertise.</p>

Like art, you'll know it when you see it. Within reason: an eight week sprint is probably too long, and a week is about as short as it makes sense to go."}, "2"=>{"points"=>"10", "truthiness"=>"1", "id"=>"15", "abody"=>"The length of your sprint doesn't really mater.", "feedback"=>"True enough--different teams work differently. Some prefer a shorter sprint cycle than others. But when you're new to agile, it can be good to keep is short. Jim Shore has said that teams take six sprints to get up to speed--whatever their length. So at the beginning, two weeks may be better than six."}, "3"=>{"points"=>"10", "truthiness"=>"1", "id"=>"16", "abody"=>"Shorter is better.", "feedback"=>"This is a true answer, although it's also true that duration isn't the most important thing in sprint planning, so long as you are consistent."}}, "qbody"=>"How do you decide the best length for your sprints?"}}

The error occurred while evaluating nil.image_url) on line #1 of app/views/questions/_scorecard.html.erb:

3:   <h2>How much do you know about story sizing?</h2>
4:   <p>Here are a few questions about the art of agile estimation, which we like to refer to as "story sizing." As in life, some answers are more right than others. Your task isn't to pick the "right" answer, but the best answer. Seems more realistic, doesn't it?. You'll get some points for good answers, and more points for great answers. You'll also get feedback based on your answers. We hope you learn something, whatever your level of expertise.</p>
