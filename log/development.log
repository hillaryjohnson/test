Be careful around this one!"}, "3"=>{"points"=>"0", "truthiness"=>"0", "id"=>"4", "abody"=>"Velocity is the average productivity per team member per hour.", "feedback"=>"You just revealed yourself to be a die-hard bean-counter, didn't you?

4:   <p>Here are a few questions about the art of agile estimation, which we like to refer to as "story sizing." As in life, some answers are more right than others. Your task isn't to pick the "right" answer, but the best answer. Seems more realistic, doesn't it?. You'll get some points for good answers, and more points for great answers. You'll also get feedback based on your answers. We hope you learn something, whatever your level of expertise.</p>
